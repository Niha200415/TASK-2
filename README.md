  1 High-Level System Diagram: 
  a)LOAD BALANCER :- It Distributes incoming requests across multiple application servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
  b)API Gateway:It Handles incoming requests, routes them to the Optimization API, and returns responses. It can also perform tasks like authentication, rate limiting, and caching.
  c)Container Orchestration: Manages the deployment, scaling, and management of the Optimization API containers. Kubernetes is a popular choice for container orchestration.
  d)Optimization API: The actual API that performs the optimization calculations. It's designed to handle concurrent requests and can be scaled horizontally to increase throughput.
  e)Cache Layer: Stores frequently accessed data or calculation results to reduce the load on the Optimization API and improve response times.
  f)Datastore: Stores data used by the Optimization API, such as port constraints, arrival rates, and berth limits.
  g)Monitoring System: Tracks the performance and health of the system, providing insights into latency, throughput, and errors.

  2) key components :
   - Load Balancer: Ensures even distribution of traffic and can redirect requests in case of server failure.
   - Cache: Reduces response times by serving repeated requests from memory rather than the database.
   - Datastore: Provides reliable data storage and supports ACID transactions to maintain data integrity.
   - Monitoring: Tracks system health, performance metrics, and error rates to enable proactive maintenance.
 
  3) Short note on Scaling and Handling Failures:
     * Scaling: The architecture can scale horizontally by adding more application server instances behind the load balancer. The cache can also scale to handle more data, and the 
     database can be partitioned or replicated to distribute the load.
     * Graceful Degradation: In case of failure, the system can serve cached data or provide partial functionality rather than failing completely. Implementing circuit breakers can 
       prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to failing components.
     *  Horizontal Scaling: The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the API Gateway, Optimization API, and Cache Layer. This allows the system to handle 
       increased traffic and improve responsiveness.
     * Load Balancer: The load balancer ensures that traffic is distributed efficiently across multiple instances, reducing the load on individual instances and preventing single points 
       of failure.
     * Container Orchestration: The container orchestration system ensures that containers are deployed, scaled, and managed efficiently. It can also handle failures by restarting or 
        replacing containers as needed.
     * Cache Layer: The cache layer reduces the load on the Optimization API by storing frequently accessed data or calculation results. This improves response times and reduces the 
        likelihood of failures due to high load.
     * Monitoring System: The monitoring system provides insights into the performance and health of the system, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues.
